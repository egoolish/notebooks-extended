# RAPIDS Extended Notebooks
## Intro
Welcome to the extended notebooks repo!

The purpose of this collection of notebooks is to help users understand what RAPIDS has to offer, learn why, how, and when including RAPIDS in a data science pipeline makes sense, and contain community contributions of RAPIDS knowledge. 

Many of these notebooks use additional PyData ecosystem packages, and include code for downloading datasets, thus they require network connectivity. If running on a system with no network access, please use the [core notebooks repo](https://github.com/rapidsai/notebooks).

## Installation

Please use the [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) to check the pre-requisite packages and installation steps.

## Contributing

Please see our [guide for contributing to notebooks-extended](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Exploring the Repo

- `getting_started_notebooks` - “how to start using RAPIDS”.  Contains notebooks showing "hello worlds", getting started with RAPIDS libraries, and tutorials around RAPIDS concepts.   
- `intermediate` - “how to accomplish your workflows with RAPIDS”.  Contains notebooks showing algorthim and workflow examples, benchmarking tools, and some complete end-to-end (E2E) workflows.
- `advanced` - "how to master RAPIDS".  Contains notebooks showing kernal customization and advanced end-to-end workflows.
- `colab_notebooks` - contains colab versions of popular notebooks to quickly try out in browser
- `blog notebooks` - contains shared notebooks mentioned and used in blogs that showcase RAPIDS workflows and capabilities
- `conference notebooks` - contains notebooks used in conferences, such as GTC
- `competition notebooks` - contains notebooks used in competitions, such as Kaggle

`/data` contains small data samples used for purely functional demonstrations. Some notebooks include cells that download larger datasets from external websites.

The `/data` folder is also symlinked into `/rapids/notebooks/extended/data` so you can browse it from JupyterLab's UI.
